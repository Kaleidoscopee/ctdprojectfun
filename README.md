After heavy frustrations with both trying to work with the original repository Dog-And-Cat-App-August

    Repository - (https://github.com/Kaleidoscopee/Dog-And-Cat-App-August)

and ever evolving errors of repository ctdprework

    https://github.com/Kaleidoscopee/ctdprework

I've decided to start fresh while reusing the concepts I've freshly re-learned attempting to do it twice. The first one was likely a mistake of making a vite folder within the project main directory leading to file issues. The second likely being countless errors of me rushing in an attemp to get my new API working. While I was able to get the fetch API to work with the weather API (https://open-meteo.com/) the API itself was only returning temperatures well above land at 91 Meters, and knowing it's 168 degrees Farenheight above Times Square isn't really helpful. I attempted to get the API call from the cat/dog API (https://thedogapi.com/), and was able to with VITE_ but that left my key exposed. I think I understand how to keep it hidden within my env. now and hopefully my npm run dev now works to code live.

Now somehow the Gitbash is a mess to work with in terms of deleting old commits from Github and I'm worried i can't even get a proper project going let alone turn it in on time. I'm losing it. 
Maybe this will help? (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13716658/how-to-delete-all-commit-history-in-github)
HAHA IT WORKED

Going to follow (https://youtube.com/watch?v=17UVejOw3zA&t=182s) and hope it makes enough sense to hide my api key. 




# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
